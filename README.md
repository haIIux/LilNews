### LilNews - Using [Lil Apps](https://lil.software/api/) by [Jordan Singer](https://github.com/jordansinger)!

This is a small SwiftUI app in which was used to learn how to hook into APIs programatically. The goal with this is going to be to expound upon the current code 
with solid documentation which can be used throughout my development career as a reference point.
